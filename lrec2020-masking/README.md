# Cross Domain Fact Verification: 

This is the accompanying code for our LREC2020 paper(link will be updated once the proceedings are out in may 2020) 

This code has two steps:
- Step 1: data delexicalization code which is kept under the `tagging/` folder
- Step 2: using that data to do training/testing using neuralnetworks which is kept under the `nn/` folder.

Please refer to the instructions in the respective folders.
